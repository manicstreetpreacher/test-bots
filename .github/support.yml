  Hi there @{issue-author} :wave:!

  I closed this issue because it was labelled as a support question.

  Please repost this on the http://discourse.jupyter.org/ forum (where most of the people who hang out here also hang out, as well as more people).
  We are trying to streamline the different discussion places and want to use the issues on GitHub repos for technical discussions on how to change the contents of the repo.
  More general discussions should go to Discourse so that they are easier to find, better indexed by google and generally more accessible than being hidden in the bowls of a GitHub repository :smiley:

  Thanks!
